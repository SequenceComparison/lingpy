LingPy 1.0
==========

This is the first version of LingPy, a Python library for quantitative tasks in historical linguistics, which served as the code basis for the experiments conducted in my doctoral thesis on "Sequence comparison in historical linguistics". As of the moment, a more recent version of LingPy is available under http://lingpy.org.
